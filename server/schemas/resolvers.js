// a resolver can accept 4 args in the ff order
// parent: This is if we used nested resolvers to handle more complicated actions, as it would hold the reference to the resolver that executed the nested resolver function
// args: This is an object of all of the values passed into a query or mutation request as parameters.  In our case, we destructure the username parameter out to be used.
// context:  This will come into play later. If we were to need the same data to be accessible by all resolvers, such as a logged-in user's status or API access token, this data will come through this context parameter as an object
// info: This will contain extra information about an operation's current state. This isn't used as frequently, but it can be implemented for more advanced uses.
