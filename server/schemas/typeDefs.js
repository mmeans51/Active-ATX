// setup of a GraphQL API involves defining two very important things
// Type Definitions - defining every piece of data that the client can expect to work with through a query or mutation
// Think of this as not only defining the API endpoint, but also defining the exact data and parameters that are tied to that endpoint
// Resolvers - functions we connect to each query or mutation type definition that perform the CRUD actions

// create our typeDefs
// Tagged templates are an advanced use of template literals
